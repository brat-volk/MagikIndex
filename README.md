<b><h3>ðŸš§Work In ProgressðŸš§</h3></b>

-----------------------------------------------------

A magical keylogger from a land far away...
Currently pretty advanced at over 2k lines of code.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

<b> <h3> Features </h3> </b> </br>
<ul>
  <li><b> As of 09/07/2022 we are FUD on antiscan and have 3% detection rate on HA. ðŸ˜Ž</b></li></br>
  <li>Retrieves logs to any email address. Even if an internet connection is absent at the time of logging.</li>
  <li>Even after it is deleted the logs will still persist and will be sent back anyways.</li>
  <li>Crypts all logs, only decryptable with the decrypter.</li>
  <li>Auto-updates using GitHub Repo.</li>
  <li>Offers an unencrypted and VM-friendly mode for debugging purposes.</li>
  <li>Files are Winzip compressed, with lz4 W.I.P.</li>
  <li>ScreenGrabbing is working, with ScreenShot-On-Click and more W.I.P.</li>
  <li>Features a wide range of diagnostic info with more on the way.</li>
  <li>Pretty persistent: creates multiple copies of itself, so if one is deleted the other ones take its place.</li>
  <li>Has a system-wide evaluation and trust system that includes various kinds of VM/debugging/anti-malware checks(some are pretty unusual).</li>
  <li>Offers lots of easy customization with #defines at the start of the Common header.</li>
</ul>

<b> <h3> Screenshots </h3> </b>

<b>Unfortunately a single log now takes up more than 4-5 screenshots, so i'll replace them with a link to two demo logs: a crypted and an unencrypted one.</b>

Don't use my code for some shitty HackForums/RaidForums malware pasta, or at least credit me ;P</br></br>
<b>Be aware that i don't take any responsibility for the potential harm caused by this program.</b>
